# QOptimizer
A port of the Windows Optimizer (by deadmoon) to Qt5.


### Summary:
 
Utility that helps you customize Windows to your needs, while increasing privacy and security.
Optimizer is recommended after a fresh, clean installation of Windows to enable, disable or tweak services (and settings) that you actually fit your needs.

* **NOT** .NET Framework dependent
* Portable (command line and Windows UI versions)
* **Still Under Development**


### Personal thought: 

Windows, after installation, is configured in a way that tries to fill every type of user needs. Even though most services are idle, they aren't footprint free, they take very little CPU and memory power, but multiply that by millions of users worldwide and every day... In the end, that amounts to a more significant wasted energy.
